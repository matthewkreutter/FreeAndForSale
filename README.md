# FreeAndForSale

This is a PHP Laravel web app that I made with the intention of replacing my university's "Free And For Sale" Facebook page. The Facebook page serves as a localized Craigslist for just Wash U students, and I wanted to replace the clunky Facebook interface with a specialized web app for buying/selling/trading items within the Wash U community. I reached a minimum viable product stage, but did not achieve the buy-in I was hoping for to actually deploy my project. In any case, I had a blast exploring PHP Laravel along the way! If you'd like to see how far I got, feel free to pull this repo and follow these steps for deploying a PHP Laravel project locally: https://gist.github.com/hootlex/da59b91c628a6688ceb1
