# FreeAndForSale

This is a PHP Laravel web app that I made with the intention of replacing my university's "Free And For Sale" Facebook page. The Facebook page serves as a localized Craigslist for just Wash U students, and I wanted to replace the clunky Facebook medium with a specialized web app. I reached a minimum viable product stage, but did not achieve the buy-in I was hoping for to actually deploy my project.
